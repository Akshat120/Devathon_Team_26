## Scholarship Portal :
## Intro : There are endless scholarships coming out throughout the Academic Year.
## Web & Software Development Cell, NIT Warangal 2
## These scholarships are circulated among the student groups over WhatsApp and
## through ROs. We lack a proper channel of communication between the admin and the students,
## through which many students miss out the opportunity of availing the same.
## Objective : Our main objective is to establish a proper system which does the following goals :
## 1) Students are able to see all the scholarships rolled out by the admin
## 2) A student can easily apply for most of the scholarships using the single button functionality
## 3) Once applied, the Student can be able to track the application of the scholarship.
## Admin Side :

## ● Instructions
## ● Opening and Last Date to apply

## M tech), Department, Specialization(in case of Mtech), Gender,
## Min CGPA,
